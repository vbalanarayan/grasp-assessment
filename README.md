# Assignment 1 - Sensor Data REST API

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: FastAPI  
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy  
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (running in a Docker container)  
- **Containerization**: Application and database are hosted in Docker containers  

## Execution Steps

The execution steps are detailed in another `README.md` file located in the `assignment1` folder.  

## Current Implementation

The current implementation is simplified but can be improved in the following areas:  

1. **Error Handling**  
   - Add better error handling and cover more edge cases.  

2. **Unit Testing**  
   - Implement unit tests to ensure reliability and catch bugs early.  

3. **Authentication**  
   - Introduce authentication mechanisms to protect the APIs.  

4. **Database Improvements**  
   - Add the TimescaleDB extension to PostgreSQL for better handling of time-series data.  
   - Alternatively, consider using another database specifically suited for time-series data.
